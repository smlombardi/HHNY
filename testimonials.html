                <h2 id="">Hungry Heart Client Testimonials on How to Lose Weight</h2>
                <p id="">Since 1996 The Hungry Heart program has been helping people from all walks of life to overcome over eating and weight loss issues.</p>
                <p id="">The Hungry Heart started assisting clients in New York and were amazed at the results they were seeing consistently. By giving clients the tools to create permanent life style changes, and working through resistance and self sabotaging
                  behavior, clients would feel better about themselves, take better care of themselves and lose weight naturally.</p>
                <p id="">The Hungry Heart has shared this process with other counselors that have struggled and worked through their issues with food. We have put together an entire process to help others in an efficient and effective manner to get the results
                  they are looking for. If we can do it, so can you!</p>

                  <p id="">Eating, snacking, binge eating and compulsive overeating were all synonymous to me. The means to temporarily filling up the emptiness that I felt inside. I would eat everything insight in hopes of feeling full. Yet, the feeling of fullness
                    never came. Instead guilt, shame, disgust, and an overwhelming feeling of how I had messed up would fill my heart and mind. At night I would obsess about how I needed to fix all of the damage I had done. &quot;Tomorrow&quot; held many
                    meanings; it meant over exercising, starving, starting a new diet, and ultimately knowing that I would fail again. &quot;Tomorrow&quot; was not a word with hope behind it. Hope had vanished when guilt and shame took over my life.</p>
                  <p id="">I knew that I could not become the person that I needed to be without help. The Hungry Heart team cares. With their help I learned to feel my emotions instead of eating them. I now see &quot;tomorrow&quot; full of opportunities and my
                    days are full of hope. I learned to recognize patterns in my behavior which helps me to make healthier choices.</p>
                  <p id="">As a counselor at Hungry Heart I know how beautiful &quot;tomorrow&quot; is when we are emotionally and physically healthy. I look forward to working with you. Together we can stop the negative self-talk and change your internal recording
                    to one of compassion, and hope for a healthy future.</p>

                  <p id="">My experience was very good. I had just moved to New York and started a new job - so there were a lot of changes to deal with. Self-doubt with these changes led to a lot of internal negativity. The Hungry Heart Program helped me to slow
                    down, think and become more positive about myself. The lessons also helped me improve my nutritional habits and exercise. I am very happy that I have had this experience.</p>

                  <p id="">I had come to a cross road in my life. I know what the past has been like and I wanted to improve upon my future. I came to Hungry Heart seeking advice and direction. I have found much of what I have been looking for. I will continue
                    to implement what I have learned to achieve my goals of happiness, success, and weight maintenance.</p>

                  <p id="">When I read the ad for the Hungry Heart, what drew me to the program was that it stated that I would be able to get over or let go of the obsession with food. Also, that the counselors had all experienced food issues. This was important
                    to me because I don&#39;t think a person can help another unless they are sharing their experience.</p>
                  <p id="">The life changes that have taken place for me since I started are monumental and they are all due to a shift in my thoughts, actions, and attitude about myself. Thank you for giving me my self esteem back and life tools to live my life
                    to the fullest.</p>

                  <p id="">I feel that my time spent with the Hungry Heart has probably been the most beneficial time of my life. I have learned to take control of my eating habits and experience the feeling I encounter on a daily basis. My tools are helping me
                    approach life&#39;s situations in a positive and productive manner. Most of all, I approach each day in an honest and reality based way. I will never forget how this program has changed my life.</p>

                  <p id="">When I began the program, I was eating enormous amounts of food, particularly sweets and chocolate. I always felt out of control, always indulged alone and in private. I would beat myself up with negative thoughts, essentially emotionally
                    abusing myself for eating this way and gaining weight. This program has led me to a place of peace and acceptance with my body and my eating.</p>
                  <p id="">I can finally accept my body and actually value it and care for it by feeding it only nutritious whole foods. I am excited about continuing this growth. This program has opened up a whole new level of learning and understanding regarding
                    nutrition and health. I am very thankful for this opportunity.</p>

                  <p id="">I feel that this program really worked for me. It addressed my emotional eating - an issue that none of my other diets or programs addressed. I knew how to lose weight. I knew how to eat and how to exercise. I just didn&#39;t know why
                    I wasn&#39;t implementing these aspects to lose weight.</p>
                  <p id="">The Hungry Heart Program taught me why my &quot;former dieting self&quot; persona wasn&#39;t working. You taught me how to retrain my mind, let go of old negative patterns that were holding me back, and gave me the tools to recognize
                    bad habits and overcome them. I feel a renewed sense of self and confidence to be healthy, happy and me! Thank you so much!</p>
